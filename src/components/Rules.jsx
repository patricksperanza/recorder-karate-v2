        Belt Tests: belt tests will be held during the last 10 minutes of each
        music class as well as before and after school on certain days/times.
        Please find the sign up sheet in the music classroom to sign up for belt
        tests.
      </p>
      <p>
        To receive your belt, you must play the piece of music with NO MISTAKES.
        This means you must play with appropriate tone, correct rhythms and
        pitches, and breathe in the appropriate places. Each student is allowed
        ONE restart/do-over for a belt test. If you do not receive your belt
        after a test, you have to wait until the next week to test. Only ONE
        test per week is allowed. You may not test for multiple belts in the
        same week.
      </p>

        If you have received your Black Belt in Recorder Karate, you will be
        able to move on to Recorder Karate LEVEL 2 (in process).
